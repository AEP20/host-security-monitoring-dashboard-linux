✅ HIDS PROJECT — CONTEXT PROMPT 

We are developing a lightweight “Host Security Monitoring Dashboard” (HIDS) for a single Linux machine.
The purpose of the project is to collect system logs, metrics, processes, and open ports, analyze them, detect suspicious activity using rule-based logic, and show everything on a Flask-based web dashboard.

🔎 Technologies

Python 3

Flask (backend + UI templates)

SQLite (local database)

SQLAlchemy ORM

psutil (metrics & process collection)

APScheduler or a simple scheduler loop

Vanilla JS + HTML templates (Flask Jinja) for frontend

The architecture is a simple monolith; not microservices.

🧠 Core System Logic

Collectors

Gather raw data from the local machine:
CPU/RAM/disk metrics, processes, open ports, system logs (auth.log, syslog, kern.log, dpkg.log).

Parsers

Convert raw log lines into structured events:
FAILED_LOGIN, ROOT_LOGIN, SERVICE_FAILED, etc.

Rule Engine

Contains individual rules such as:

SSH brute force detection

Root login detection

Suspicious process detection

Unexpected open ports

Log deletion detection

Rule engine runs on parsed events and system state → generates Alerts.

Config Checker

Periodically analyzes SSH config, file permissions, firewall state, cron jobs, and world-writable directories.

Produces PASS/WARN/FAIL results with severities.

Scheduler

Runs collectors, parsers, rule engine, and config checkers at defined intervals.

Database Models (SQLAlchemy)

MetricModel: CPU/RAM/disk/time-series metrics

LogEventModel: Parsed events from system logs

AlertModel: Alerts produced by the rule engine

ConfigCheckModel: Configuration hardening results

API Layer

/api/metrics

/api/alerts

/api/processes

/api/ports

/api/config

Frontend (Flask Templates)

🎯 Project scale expectations

This is a student project—not enterprise—so simplicity > complexity.

Single host only (no multi-agent architecture).

Dashboard refresh via AJAX every few seconds is enough.

Lightweight, maintainable structure preferred over microservices.

Future scalability is nice but not required.

🧩 What help I need from ChatGPT

“When I ask anything in this chat, assume I am continuing this specific project.
Your answers must align with this architecture, folder structure, database models, and goals.
Do not suggest unnecessary complexity (like Kubernetes, microservices, Docker Swarm, or event-driven clusters).
Give clean, scalable, maintainable solutions following this project’s structure.”
